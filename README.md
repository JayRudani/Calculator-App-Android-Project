# Calculator-App-Android-Project

A Calculator made in Android studio which has following functionalities:

1. User Interface related java code (CalcActivity.java).

2. The Calculator class include the logic of ALL the calculator functions, including
the memory logic as well as processing of both integers and real numbers.

3. Memory buttons to the calculator project (MC, M+, M-, MR) and a
memory variable/property in the app logic. The functions of these 4 buttons are
to clear, add to, subtract from, and recall the memory. The function of each button is as
follows:
a. M+ adds the displayed number to memory
b. M- subtracts the displayed number from memory
c. MC clears the memory (i.e. resets the memory variable to Zero)
d. MR recalls the memory (bring the memory variable value back to display)

4. Calculator will have a percentage (%) button and clear (C) buttons. 
% button works like Googleâ€™s calculator percentage button found
in https://www.google.com/search?q=google+calculator for all of the basic operations
(x+y% , x-y%, x*y%, x/y%, x%). And C button will clear the current displayed
number when clicked once, then it will clear all of the previous calculations (reset the
calculator) when it is clicked again (right after the first time).
